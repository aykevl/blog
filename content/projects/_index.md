Over the years I've made a few electronic projects, some of which I've written about.

## [36-LED earrings](/projects/earrings-rgb36)

Newer earrings I've made with 36 RGB LEDs, based on the much more powerful (and more power efficient) STM32L031 microcontroller.

## [18-LED Earrings](/projects/earrings)

My older LED earrings with 18 RGB LEDs based on the ATtiny1616 microcontroller. They are great at a rave!

## [LED strip](/projects/ledstrip)

A long time ago, I made a [LED strip controller using a DigiSpark and two buttons](/projects/ledstrip) - nothing else.
