Over the years I've made a few electronic projects, some of which I've written about.

## [LED strip](/projects/ledstrip)

A long time ago, I made a [LED strip controller using a DigiSpark and two buttons](/projects/ledstrip) - nothing else.

## [Earrings](/projects/earrings)

I've made RGB LED earrings based on the ATtiny1616 microcontroller. They are great at a rave!
