I've made new and improved RGB LED earrings, with double the LEDs compared to my [previous LED earrings](../earrings). They also have some other improvements: they're more power efficient and the LEDs just look a lot better.

You can find the KiCad design files, source code, and instructions on how to program them [on the GitHub page](https://github.com/aykevl/things/tree/master/earring-ring-rgb36).

I will soon start [selling them on Lectronz](https://lectronz.com/stores/nightvibe).
