I've made RGB LED earrings, like these:

You can find all the instructions on how to program it [on the GitHub page](https://github.com/aykevl/things/tree/master/earring-ring).

I made these initially because I wanted to wear them myself, but as it turns out they're quite popular. I will soon [sell them on Lectronz](https://lectronz.com/stores/nightvibe).
