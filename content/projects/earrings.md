I've made RGB LED earrings, like these:

You can find all the instructions on how to program it [on the GitHub page](https://github.com/aykevl/things/tree/master/earring-ring).

I made these initially because I wanted to wear them myself, but as it turns out they're quite popular. You can [buy them on Lectronz](https://lectronz.com/products/led-ring-earrings).

The design is [available on oshwlab.com](https://oshwlab.com/aykevanlaethem/led-earring-attiny1616_copy_copy_copy_copy) if you want to build your own.
